        <p id="introduction"> On any given day, even with the drop in air traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there
            are thousands of airplanes flying over the United States and the rest of the world — commercial jets,
            general aviation and private aircraft and military planes from various armed forces. If you are an AvGeek,
            you know that there are apps and sites you can use to track those planes and tell exactly what the one
            you’ve just seen fly over is. You can use them to track aircraft you cannot see, too.
            With 2kAeroStack, you can find out granular details including how fast and high a flight is, its route, the exact airplane operating it and when it was built, and what routes it flew before, even months in the past.
