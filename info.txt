Airline Designator Codes
Those companies assigned an IATA Airline Designator Code are to use such designators
 for reservations, schedules, timetables, telecommunications, ticketing, cargo documentation, 
 legal, tariffs and/or other commercial/traffic purposes.

If you are interested in reviewing your eligibility and/or applying for an IATA Designator Code,
 please visit our IATA Codes page accessible via the IATA Customer Portal. Requirements are explained in
  the IATA Designator Code Requirements document (pdf).

by yearly passenger volume with the name, 3-letter IATA code, time zone and coordinates of each airport.
